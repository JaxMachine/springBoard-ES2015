// 1. Using “var” as the variable declaration allows you to reassign and redeclare. “Let” cannot be redeclared. “Var can be hoisted and “let” creates block scope.
// 2. Using “var” as the variable declaration allows you to reassign and redeclare. You cannot redeclare or reassign with “const.” “Const” also creates block scope.
// 3. You can reassign variables declared with “let” but “const” is much more restrive and you cannot reassign or redeclare with “const”
